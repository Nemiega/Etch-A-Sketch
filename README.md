In this project, I created a browser-based application that serves as a combination of a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch, demonstrating my strong DOM manipulation skills for my portfolio.

The project was intentionally challenging, requiring me to frequently search for and utilize JavaScript methods and CSS properties, which allowed me to expand my knowledge and problem-solving abilities. While I followed the provided guidelines and instructions for the basic steps, the actual implementation and creativity were entirely up to me, showcasing my ability to independently apply the concepts I've learned.
